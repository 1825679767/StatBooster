# ![Azeroth Core](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azerothcore/azerothcore.github.io/master/images/logo-github.png) Azeroth Core
⚠️ !! This module is not ready yet !! ⚠️
## About
This is a module for the [Azeroth Core](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk) inspired by the [RandomEnchants](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-random-enchants) module. 
The module will randomly enchant items with stats that compliment the current stats on the item.
I am developing this module to put it in a slightly different direction and to fix some bugs that are included in the original module.

This is my first C++ project so any tips are appreciated and welcome! :)

## Features
The features I have planned for this module that differ from the original are:
 - Stat Analysis - Items are analyzed and enchanted based on stats already on the item. (I.e. No more strength on cloth spell gear)
 - Group Rolling - Items that have been rolled for will be enchanted as well.
