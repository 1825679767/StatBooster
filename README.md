# Azeroth Core Module - Stat Booster
This module is inspired by the RandomEnchants module. I am developing this module to put it in a slightly different direction and to fix some bugs that are included in the original module.

This is my first C++ project so any tips are appreciated and welcome! :)

## Features
The features I have planned for this module that differ from the original are:
 - Stat Analysis - Items are analyzed and enchanted based on stats already on the item. (I.e. No more strength on cloth spell gear)
 - Group Rolling - Items that have been rolled for will be enchanted as well.
